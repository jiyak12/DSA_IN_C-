//middle node of the linked list
//optimal approach by tortoise and hare algorithm
/*
Step 1: Initialise two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list. `slow` will advance one step at a time, while `fast` will advance two steps at a time. These pointers will move simultaneously.

Step 2: Traverse the linked list with the `slow` and `fast` pointers. While traversing, repeatedly move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time.

Step 3: Continue this traversal until fast reaches the end of the list (i.e., fast or fast.next is null), the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
  When the linked list has an odd number of nodes, fast.next ensures that the fast pointer doesn't go past the end of the list. In this case, fast reaches the last node, and fast.next becomes null, signalling the end of the traversal.
  When the linked list has an even number of nodes, fast will reach the end of the list and be null, which still signifies the end of the traversal.
