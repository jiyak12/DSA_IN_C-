//sliding window maximum
//Given an array of integers arr, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

//push the new element in from the rear of our de-queue
//Every time before entering a new element,check whether the element present at the front is out of bounds of present window size. If so,pop. Also,check from the rear that the element present is smaller than the incoming element. If yes, thereâ€™s no point storing them and hence pop them out. Finally, the element present at the front would be our largest element.
